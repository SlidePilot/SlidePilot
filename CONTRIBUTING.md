# Contribution Guidelines
Please read this, before contributing and make sure you follow the described steps.

### Preparation
This repository uses the [git flow pattern](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/). When contributing to the codebase with a pull request, please make sure you follow this patterns. This means for example, that new features branch off of the *develop* branch, with a branch named *feature/<short-description>*.
  
### Code contribution rules
Please make sure you **thoroughly test** the application after you've implemented the feature. Not only test the feature but also the **base functionality**, even if you think you feature doesn't interfere with it. Unwanted side effects can always occur, so it is best practice to also test that your implementation didn't break some other functionality.
  
Also make sure that your code is well documented using **comments** describing your actions.
